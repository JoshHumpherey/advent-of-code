# 🎄 Advent of Code 🎄

## For those who celebrate, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a Christmas advent calendar of leetcode-style programming puzzles. This repo holds my past solutions and helper libraries to make getting those 50 ⭐'s that much easier!

#### Using the setup script
To automate the process of getting started each day I created a script to automate the creation of basic files that will be needed - just run the following script to create everything you'll need for a given year / day! 
```bash
# When setting up for Python
./setup.sh 2023 1

# When setting up for Rust
./setup_rust 2015 1
```
